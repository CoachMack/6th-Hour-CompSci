#1. Create a def function that plays a single round of rock, paper, scissors where the user inputs
#1 for rock, 2 for paper, or 3 for scissors and compares it to a random number generated to serve
#as the "opponent's hand".

#2. Create a def function that prompts the user to input if they want to play another round, and
#repeats the RPS def function if they do or exits the code if they don't.
