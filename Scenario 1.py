#Assignment: Scenario 1

#Scenario 1:
#You are a programmer for a fledgling game developer. Your team lead
#has asked you to create a nested dictionary containing five enemy
#creatures (and their properties) for combat testing. Additionally,
#the testers are asking for a way to input changes to the enemy's
#damage values for balancing, as well as having it print those changes to
#confirm they went through.

#It is up to you to decide what properties
#are important and the theme of the game.

#UPDATE: The testers have run into some bugs with your code. Some of the
#code seems to not work correctly. For example, one of the testers changed
#the damage for an enemy to 30 per attack, but when they attacked the player
#character, the health went from 100 to 10030 instead of the intended 70.
#Your team lead has asked you to fix the bug and make sure your enemy damage
#can be subtracted properly while testing.
#(HINT: The player's health is stored as an integer.)
