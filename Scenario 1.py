#Assignment: Scenario 1

#Scenario 1:
#You are a programmer for a fledgling game developer. Your team lead
#has asked you to create a nested dictionary containing five enemy
#creatures (and their properties) for combat testing. Additionally,
#the testers are asking for a way to input changes to the enemy's
#damage values for balancing, as well as having it print those changes to
#confirm they went through.

#It is up to you to decide what properties
#are important and the theme of the game.
