#Scenario 8:
#With a fresh perspective, the team lead wants you to look back and refactor the old combat code to
#be streamlined with classes so the character and enemy stats won't be built in bulky dictionaries anymore.

#(Translation: Rebuild Scenario 3 using classes instead of dictionaries, include the combat test code
#below as well.)
